    <h1>Darkest Dungeon</h1>
    <p>
        Darkest Dungeon has the player manage a roster of heroes to explore dungeons below a gothic mansion the
        player has inherited. Played out in a mix of real-time movement and turn-based combat, a core feature of
        Darkest Dungeon is the stress level of each hero that increases with further exploration and combat; a
        character sustaining a high-stress level may gain afflictions that will hamper, or possibly enhance, their
        performance as an explorer.

    <h1>Zelda</h1>
    <p>
        The series centers on the various incarnations of Link, a courageous young Hylian man, with pointy, elf-like
        ears; and Princess Zelda, a magical princess who is the mortal reincarnation of the goddess Hylia; as they fight
        to save the magical land of Hyrule from Ganon, an evil warlord turned demon king, who is the principal
        antagonist of the series. Ganon wishes to use the Triforce, a sacred relic left behind by the three goddesses
        that created Hyrule, to remake the world in his own dark image. When gathered together, the power of the
        Triforce can grant any wish its user desires; however, if someone with a heart that does not possess a balance
        of the three virtues of Power, Courage, and Wisdom attempts to touch the Triforce, it will split into three
        triangles and bond with three people whose hearts embody the required virtue.

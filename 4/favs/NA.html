    <h1>Nier Automata</h1>
    <p>
        Set during a proxy war between alien-created machines and human-crafted androids, the story follows the trials
        of
        combat android 2B, scanner android 9S, and rogue prototype A2. The story requires multiple playthroughs, each
        unlocking additional story elements. Gameplay combines role-playing elements with action-based hack and slash
        combat, and features switching between video game genres similar to that of Nier with elements ranging from
        shoot 'em up to text adventure.
